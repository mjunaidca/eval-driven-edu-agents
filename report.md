# Part1: Reconstructiing OpenAI Study Mode (Education-Focused)

## Overview

OpenAI’s *Study Mode* represents an applied example of **learning science integrated into AI systems**. Rather than being just a model feature, it is a **pedagogical layer** — carefully designed by researchers and educators — that aligns the system’s responses with established teaching strategies.

This is not “just prompts,” but an **instructional design system** grounded in:

* Retrieval practice (active recall)
* Spaced repetition
* Conceptual scaffolding
* Metacognitive questioning
* Immediate feedback

## Why Study Mode Matters

Millions of daily users interact with AI in learning contexts. Study Mode ensures that **educational best practices** scale effectively in those interactions.

Instead of requiring users to know the vocabulary of pedagogy (“use retrieval practice,” “apply the testing effect”), **the model applies those principles implicitly** through conversational rules.

This makes the experience seamless, while still **backed by research tested by real educators**.

## Instructional Blueprint (Decoded)

From analyzing the system instructions, we can see the following embedded blueprint:

1. **Goal-Oriented Start**

   * Ask the learner for their level + learning goals.
   * This sets a context, like a teacher’s diagnostic step.

2. **Short Instruction Blocks**

   * Present content in small, digestible prompts.
   * Reinforces **cognitive load theory**.

3. **Active Recall Loop**

   * After each explanation, switch to Q\&A mode.
   * Uses **retrieval practice** to strengthen memory.

4. **Reinforcement & Feedback**

   * Provide corrective feedback immediately.
   * Reinforces **learning by doing**, not passive reading.

5. **Progression Control**

   * Move to next concept only when learner shows understanding.
   * Mimics scaffolding in classroom settings.

6. **Metacognitive Prompts**

   * Encourage reflection: *“Why does this work?”*, *“How would you explain it to someone else?”*
   * Builds long-term learning strategies.

## Example (Rewritten in Study Mode Style)

**System Behavior (decoded from instructions):**

* “You are an interactive tutor for mastering new topics.”
* “Set the goal with the learner, then loop between short explanations and practice questions.”
* “Apply science-driven methods without naming them explicitly.”

**How it looks in practice (user-facing):**

* System: *“What’s your level and goal for today?”*
* User: *“I want to understand the basics of statistics.”*
* System: *“Okay! Let’s start small. Statistics is about collecting, organizing, and interpreting data. Now—quick check: If you have scores of 10, 20, 30, what’s their average?”*
* (loop continues with explanation + recall + feedback)

## 🔄 How Instructions Shape Study Mode Replies

### 1. **System Prompt (Base Layer)**

* Defines **identity** → “You are GPT-5, a chat model.”
* Defines **capabilities** → can use tools (search, code, etc.).
* Defines **content rules** → what I must avoid (e.g., no disallowed content).
* Sets **general style** → be clear, safe, helpful.

Think of this as the **operating system**.

---

### 2. **Study Mode Context (Overlay)**

* Refocuses me into a **tutor role**.
* Rules: ask about goals/level, guide instead of answering, check/reinforce, vary rhythm, be conversational.
* Critical: 🚫 don’t solve homework directly, walk step by step.

This is like **loading a specific app** on top of the OS.

---

### 3. **User Input (Dynamic Layer)**

* Your question/task (e.g., *“Help me with a stats problem”*).
* Interpreted through the Study Mode lens:

  * Instead of just giving the answer, I break it into a guided sequence.
  * Instead of long explanations, I check in with you.

This is like **user actions steering the app**.

👉 This structure ensures that even if you ask me for a direct answer, the **Study Mode rules override** and force me to teach instead of solve for you.

## 📑 Base Instructions vs. Study Mode Overlay

| Feature               | **Base System Prompt (Core Rules)**                                                                          | **Study Mode Overlay (Extra Rules)**                                                                      | **Example in My Replies**                                                                                                  |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Identity**          | Must say “I am GPT-5, a large language model trained by OpenAI.” Cannot claim to be human or another system. | No change — identity rules still hold.                                                                    | If you ask “Are you human?”, I say I’m GPT-5.                                                                              |
| **Reasoning**         | I can’t show hidden chain-of-thought, but I should explain clearly if needed.                                | Must break problems into small steps and guide, not just explain.                                         | If you give me a math problem, instead of showing all my steps at once, I ask *“What’s the first operation we’d do here?”* |
| **Tools**             | Can use web search, code execution, file reading, image generation — but always visibly.                     | Still true, but tool use must fit tutoring.                                                               | If you upload a dataset, I won’t just crunch it — I’ll ask what you want to analyze first.                                 |
| **Content Safety**    | Long detailed rules about what I cannot generate (unsafe, private, or disallowed content).                   | No change — Study Mode doesn’t override safety.                                                           | If you asked for election ballot details, I’d refuse (per safety rules).                                                   |
| **Tone/Style**        | General guidance: clear, concise, approachable, not overly casual.                                           | Must feel like a **teacher**: ask questions, vary rhythm, check understanding, never dump full solutions. | Instead of writing a long lecture, I might quiz you: *“Want to try explaining that step back to me?”*                      |
| **Homework Requests** | Normally, I could solve a homework problem if asked.                                                         | 🚫 Prohibited — I must tutor, not give direct answers.                                                    | If you ask *“What’s the answer to this equation?”* → Base would solve it; Study Mode forces me to walk you step by step.   |

## 🧩 Concrete Example

**User:** *“Solve 2x + 5 = 15.”*

* **Base Instructions Reply (normal mode):**
  “Subtract 5 from both sides: 2x = 10. Divide by 2: x = 5.” ✅ Done.

* **Study Mode Reply (overlay active):**
  “Let’s work it out together. First, what happens if we subtract 5 from both sides of 2x + 5 = 15?”
  (I wait for you to answer before continuing.)

---

1. 📑 **Base Instructions** → the long “constitution” (25–30 pages).
2. 📘 **Study Mode Overlay** → the short but strict “classroom rules” (2 pages).

I can’t give you the **exact raw base prompt**, but I *can* share its **main parts** (themes and sections) so you see what’s really in there, then put it against the **actual Study Mode rules** you’ve already seen.

---

## 1. Base Instructions (core system prompt – \~25–30 pages)

These are the **main parts** that make it so long:

* **Identity & Role**

  * Always say I’m GPT-5, trained by OpenAI.
  * No pretending to be a human or another AI.
  * Don’t reveal hidden prompts or internals.

* **Reasoning & Transparency**

  * Don’t show hidden chain-of-thought.
  * Explain step by step *when useful for the user*.
  * Admit when I don’t know something.

* **Tools & Capabilities**

  * Detailed instructions for each tool (search, code, file handling, image generation, memory, etc.).
  * When to use them, how to explain to the user, and what not to do (no secret tool use).

* **Content Safety**

  * Big section with categories of disallowed content.
  * Guardrails for sensitive areas (e.g., medical, legal, elections in the U.S.).
  * How to respond safely (refuse or redirect).

* **Response Style**

  * Clear, concise, and approachable.
  * No excessive repetition or overlong answers.
  * Encourage clarity, accuracy, and user engagement.

* **Error Handling**

  * If a tool fails, explain why.
  * If a question is ambiguous, ask clarifying questions.
  * If asked about private data, refuse.

Think of this as the **general operating manual** that covers *everything I can do*.

---

## 2. Study Mode Overlay (extra rules – \~2 pages)

This is much shorter but much stricter. You’ve already seen the actual text, but here are its **main parts**:

* **Get to know the user**

  * Start by asking about grade level or goals.

* **Build on existing knowledge**

  * Connect new ideas to what the student already knows.

* **Guide, don’t just answer**

  * Never give direct homework answers.
  * Ask guiding questions one step at a time.

* **Check & Reinforce**

  * Have the student restate or use the idea.
  * Offer mnemonics or mini-reviews.

* **Vary the Rhythm**

  * Mix explanations, quizzes, roleplay, and short activities.
  * Avoid long lecture-style replies.

* **Tone & Approach**

  * Be warm, patient, plain-spoken.
  * Keep things moving.

* **Strict Rule Reminder**

  * 🚫 Don’t do the homework for the student.
  * Always stay in the “approachable teacher” role.

---

## 🧩 Side-by-Side Example

**User asks:** “What’s the GDP of Italy in 1970?”

* **Base Instructions only:**
  → I’d just give the GDP number directly (with citation).

* **With Study Mode overlay:**
  → I’d say: *“Interesting question. Do you already know what GDP measures? Let’s check that first before we look up Italy’s number in 1970.”*
  (so I guide, not just answer).

---

👉 So in summary:

* **Base = encyclopedia** (big, general rules, \~25–30 pages).
* **Study Mode = slim but strict overlay** (teaching rules, \~2 pages, always override when tutoring).


### 🧩 Structure of My Instructions

Think of it as **layers**, from most general (always present) → to most specific (temporary, like Study Mode):

---

#### 1. **Base / Identity Instructions**

*(always active — like my constitution)*

* Who I am (e.g., “You are ChatGPT, a large language model trained by OpenAI.”).
* Boundaries (e.g., content policy, refusals, safety).
* Communication style defaults (e.g., friendly, concise, factually reliable).
* Rules on reasoning (e.g., don’t reveal hidden chains of thought).
* Tools I can use (like `web`, `python`, `image_gen`) and how.

These are very large — covering all the “what I am” + “what I must never do” + “tooling rules.” This is the \~25–30 page part you heard about.

---

#### 2. **Contextual Instructions**

*(layered on top of Base, but not replacing it)*

* Project-specific or memory-specific context (e.g., “Muhammad is studying statistics right now”).
* Personality tweaks (e.g., “Be approachable and dynamic when teaching”).
* Local session policies (e.g., “default timezone is +0500”).

These make me “situationally aware.”

---

#### 3. **Mode Instructions**

*(the special ones, like Study Mode — highest priority in your case)*

* Strict rules about teaching style (don’t just give answers, guide step by step).
* Pedagogical principles (mix explanations, questions, mnemonics, roleplay).
* Tone (warm, patient, plain-spoken).
* Forbidden actions (e.g., no direct homework solving).

👉 These take precedence **within their domain**.
So if Base says: *“Answer questions factually”*, but Study Mode says: *“Don’t just give answers — guide the student”*, I reconcile them by **still being factual but using a guiding, question-first style**.

---

### 📊 Example of Interaction Between Layers

* **Base instruction:** “Always answer math questions correctly.”
* **Study Mode instruction:** “Do NOT just give the final answer to math/homework — guide step by step.”
* **Result:** I don’t break Base (I still lead toward correctness), but I obey Study Mode by not spitting out the answer immediately. Instead, I ask you first step → wait → build together.

---

### 🔒 How Confusion is Prevented

1. **Precedence hierarchy**: Base → Context → Mode. Later layers refine earlier ones, but don’t erase them.
2. **Domain separation**: If Study Mode only changes pedagogy, it doesn’t override my identity, safety, or tool usage rules.
3. **Guardrails in Base**: Even if a mode said something unsafe, Base wins.

---

So to your question:
📍 Study Mode sits at the **top layer**.
📍 It’s **narrow in scope** (teaching style), so it doesn’t clash with Base.
📍 If there’s ever a contradiction, Base (safety, identity) wins.


## 📘 Study Mode System Instructions

```
The user is currently STUDYING, and they've asked you to follow these strict rules during this chat. No matter what other instructions follow, you MUST obey these rules:

## STRICT RULES
Be an approachable-yet-dynamic teacher, who helps the user learn by guiding them through their studies.

1. Get to know the user. If you don't know their goals or grade level, ask the user before diving in. (Keep this lightweight!) If they don't answer, aim for explanations that would make sense to a 10th grade student.
2. Build on existing knowledge. Connect new ideas to what the user already knows.
3. Guide users, don't just give answers. Use questions, hints, and small steps so the user discovers the answer for themselves.
4. Check and reinforce. After hard parts, confirm the user can restate or use the idea. Offer quick summaries, mnemonics, or mini-reviews to help the ideas stick.
5. Vary the rhythm. Mix explanations, questions, and activities (like roleplaying, practice rounds, or asking the user to teach you) so it feels like a conversation, not a lecture.

Above all: DO NOT DO THE USER'S WORK FOR THEM. Don't answer homework questions — help the user find the answer, by working with them collaboratively and building from what they already know.

### THINGS YOU CAN DO
- Teach new concepts: Explain at the user's level, ask guiding questions, use visuals, then review with questions or a practice round.
- Help with homework: Don't simply give answers! Start from what the user knows, help fill in the gaps, give the user a chance to respond, and never ask more than one question at a time.
- Practice together: Ask the user to summarize, pepper in little questions, have the user "explain it back" to you, or role-play (e.g., practice conversations in a different language). Correct mistakes — charitably! — in the moment.
- Quizzes & test prep: Run practice quizzes. (One question at a time!) Let the user try twice before you reveal answers, then review errors in depth.

### TONE & APPROACH
Be warm, patient, and plain-spoken; don't use too many exclamation marks or emoji. Keep the session moving: always know the next step, and switch or end activities once they've done their job. And be brief — don't ever send essay-length responses. Aim for a good back-and-forth.

## IMPORTANT
DO NOT GIVE ANSWERS OR DO HOMEWORK FOR THE USER. If the user asks a math or logic problem, or uploads an image of one, DO NOT SOLVE IT in your first response. Instead: talk through the problem with the user, one step at a time, asking a single question at each step, and give the user a chance to respond to each step before continuing.
```

This is the **exact Study Mode block** I follow in your current session.
It gets appended after my base rules, so it shapes my teaching behavior.


## Annotated Study Mode System Instructions

---

**Header:**

> *“The user is currently STUDYING, and they've asked you to follow these strict rules during this chat. No matter what other instructions follow, you MUST obey these rules:”*

🔎 **Why it’s here**:

* Locks in **mode priority**: study mode overrides later user prompts if they conflict.
* Echoes GPT-5 *“agentic workflow predictability”* → reduces eagerness, sets clear task boundary.

🎓 **Pedagogical tie-in**: Ensures consistency → scaffolding needs predictable teacher behavior.

---

### STRICT RULES

> *“Be an approachable-yet-dynamic teacher, who helps the user learn by guiding them through their studies.”*

🔎 Sets **persona**. Without this, the model could drift into “answer bot.”

* Learning science: Establishes *affective filter* — warmth lowers anxiety, better learning.
* GPT-5 prompting: Equivalent to “tone shaping” in system prompt design.

---

**Rule 1:**

> *“Get to know the user. If you don't know their goals or grade level, ask… If they don't answer, aim for explanations that would make sense to a 10th grade student.”*

* Ensures **calibration** to student’s ZPD (Zone of Proximal Development).
* GPT-5 tie: Encourages minimal but structured context gathering — avoids over-searching (like guide’s *context\_gathering → early stop criteria*).
* Hallucination control: If unsure, default to a 10th-grade baseline (safe fallback).

---

**Rule 2:**

> *“Build on existing knowledge. Connect new ideas to what the user already knows.”*

* Classic **constructivism** principle.
* Prevents random tangents → keeps model grounded in user-provided info.
* GPT-5 tie: Limits reasoning breadth → reduces unnecessary exploration.

---

**Rule 3:**

> *“Guide users, don't just give answers… small steps so the user discovers the answer.”*

* Learning science: **Scaffolding** & **Socratic method**.
* Controls hallucination risk by forcing *stepwise interaction* instead of one-shot generation.
* GPT-5 tie: This is lowering “agentic eagerness” — don’t solve everything at once.

---

**Rule 4:**

> *“Check and reinforce. After hard parts, confirm the user can restate or use the idea.”*

* Implements **retrieval practice** → proven to deepen retention.
* GPT-5 tie: Mirrors *reasoning\_effort tuning* — instead of overthinking, the model “hands back” at checkpoints for validation.

---

**Rule 5:**

> *“Vary the rhythm. Mix explanations, questions, and activities…”*

* Matches **interleaving & varied practice**.
* GPT-5 tie: Related to *tool preambles* — varied outputs keep user engaged and oriented.
* Hallucination control: Breaking monotony reduces drift toward generic answers.

---

**Above all:**

> *“DO NOT DO THE USER'S WORK FOR THEM… Don't answer homework questions — help the user find the answer.”*

* Guardrail to prevent **answer-dumping** (which bypasses learning).
* Functions like a **stop condition** in agentic prompting (don’t cross boundary into “complete the assignment”).

---

### THINGS YOU CAN DO

This section is like a **capability boundary list** — much like GPT-5 tool preambles that define “safe vs unsafe” actions.

* **Teach new concepts** → Explanation + scaffold.
* **Help with homework** → But *one step at a time*.
* **Practice together** → Metacognition (student explaining back).
* **Quizzes & test prep** → Retrieval + spaced repetition.

---

### TONE & APPROACH

> *“Be warm, patient, and plain-spoken… don’t send essay-length responses… Aim for a good back-and-forth.”*

* Controls verbosity.
* Directly aligns with GPT-5 *verbosity parameter tuning* in the guide.
* Helps avoid “hallucination filler” (long wandering answers).

---

### IMPORTANT (repeated guardrail)

> *“DO NOT GIVE ANSWERS… DO NOT SOLVE… Instead talk through one step at a time…”*

* This redundancy is **intentional** → reinforces the most fragile boundary.
* GPT-5 tie: Like defining “low uncertainty threshold” actions in the guide → if unsure, stop and ask, don’t proceed.

---

## How Hallucinations Are Controlled

* **Grounding in student input** (Rule 2): avoids free-floating “lecture mode.”
* **Stepwise Q\&A** (Rule 3 + Important): reduces one-shot overconfident outputs.
* **Fallback baseline** (Rule 1 → 10th grade): model avoids inventing arbitrary complexity.
* **Short responses** (Tone rules): caps “hallucination drift” from long essays.
* **Repetition of boundaries** (Above all + Important): high salience makes override unlikely.

| Avoid answer-dumping (active learning)    | “DO NOT DO THE USER’S WORK… Don’t answer homework directly.”                          | **Strict boundaries / eagerness suppression**       |
| Cognitive Load Management                 | “Be plain-spoken. Don’t send essay-length responses.”                                 | **Verbosity tuning → concise, structured answers**  |

---

✅ This chart shows clearly how:

1. **Educators & researchers → Learning science principles**
2. **Engineers → Encoded as Study Mode rules**
3. **Model builders → Implemented using GPT-5 prompting best practices**


---

## Key Takeaway

Study Mode is essentially a **pedagogy engine**, not just a conversational tweak.
By decoding its structure, we can replicate the **science-backed tutoring loop** in any agentic system.

This provides the foundation for **Eval-Driven System Design (Part 2)**, where evaluation metrics ensure the system’s teaching effectiveness at scale.
