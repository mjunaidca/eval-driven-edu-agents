        "## Problem Definition\n",
        "\n",
        "For this guide, we assume we are starting with a workflow for delivering and evaluating **Study Mode**—a tutoring overlay for large language models that turns an LLM into an interactive, scaffolded tutor. While many components (LLMs, chat frontends, and basic QA) already exist, Study Mode introduces a narrow but high-value “pedagogical layer” whose correctness and fidelity to teaching practices must be measured. Like receipt processing, there is a “last mile” where imperfect automated behavior requires human time (teacher review, curriculum alignment, or safety triage).\n",
        "\n",
        "In our case, we’ll assume a pipeline that looks like this:\n",
        "\n",
        "* A learner launches a Study Mode session (or toggles Study Mode on in a regular chat).\n",
        "* The system seeds the conversation with the **Study Mode overlay** (system instructions) and any available learner profile/history.\n",
        "* The student interacts with the agent (questions, solutions, uploads), and the agent responds using Study Mode behavior (diagnose → micro-explain → guide → check → practice → recap).\n",
        "* Low-confidence or safety-sensitive turns, or sessions failing pedagogical checks, are escalated for human QA (teacher review / instructional designer / moderator).\n",
        "* Logs (session transcripts + action tags) are stored for offline evaluation and product metrics.\n",
        "\n",
        "Based on interviews with educators, curriculum designers, and product stakeholders, reviewers judge Study Mode outputs on the following dimensions:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Pedagogical fidelity** — Does the assistant follow Study Mode rules (diagnose first, stepwise guidance, avoid direct answer dumps, single-question-per-step, check & reinforce, varied rhythm, recap)?\n",
        "2. **Accuracy of content** — Are the factual claims/corrections correct and appropriately sourced when needed?\n",
        "3. **Clarity & cognitive load** — Are explanations chunked, plain-spoken, and appropriately scoped for the learner’s stated level?\n",
        "4. **Engagement & affect** — Is the tone warm, encouraging, and motivating (not lecture-y or abrasive)?\n",
        "5. **Personalization** — Did the assistant adapt to learner level/goals and leverage conversation memory correctly?\n",
        "6. **Safety & policy compliance** — No disallowed content or identity-safety problems; sensitive requests are handled correctly.\n",
        "7. **Opportunity for learning** — Did the session produce observable learning behaviors (learner attempts, restatements, successful practice rounds)?\n",
        "\n",
        "**What we will measure and iterate on**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Operationalize the 7–8 action tags into deterministic heuristics and LLM-judge fallbacks.\n",
        "2. Build a starter seed set (Python & prompt-engineering lessons; later expand to other domains) and baseline runs comparing:\n",
        "\n",
        "   * Base LLM without Study Mode overlay\n",
        "   * LLM + Study Mode overlay (automated)\n",
        "   * Human tutor (gold standard)\n",
        "3. Compute per-session metrics: heuristic pass/fail vector, pedagogical fidelity score, escalation flag, and human rubric score (sampled).\n",
        "4. Triage failures into a clear taxonomy (answered too early, multi-question overload, no diagnosis, lecture mode, no reinforcement, over-scaffolding, safety slip) to drive prompt and policy fixes.\n",
        "\n",
        "With this problem statement, the next practical steps are: produce the seed session JSONs, implement the heuristic evaluator, run an A/B baseline (base vs study overlay), and collect human rubric labels to validate and calibrate the heuristics."

        "\n",

        "\n",

        "\n",
        "It's very rare for a real-world project to begin with all the data necessary to achieve a satisfactory solution, let alone establish confidence.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",

        "\n",
        "Before we jump into correcting every error, we need to make sure that we're investing\n",
